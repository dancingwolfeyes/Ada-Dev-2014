**1.What were the weights of the cats?**

2kg, 3kg, 6kg

**2.How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process.**

(2)(3)(6)=36kg
Each of the weights could be placed in any order of multiplication and still equal 36.
We know that if there is a “littlest kitty” then there must be varying weights. Also, because we are measuring in whole kg, finding one single number to the third power that equals 36, putting all three cats at the exact same weight, would require otherwise. (I looked up average weights of cats in lbs and then looked up a conversion chart to kgs to confirm that my numbers would not be off base.)

**3.What other possible explanations are there?**

I also looked up average tarot prices and got a wide range of answers. However, it did confirm that the price list for tarot readings would most likely have shown multiple prices for longer times or varying services. This still allows for several different weight options to be plugged into our equation. Since there would not be one single price for all the weights to add up to, and without knowing what price specifically the reader was referring to, it would not help us determine exact weights leaving it open for other weight options. Since we are not given specifics on the “littlest kitty”, we are still able to plug in other weight options.

(1)(4)(9)=36kg is one example.

The “littlest kitty” could be extra small from young age or being very sickly. The larger weights could also be from certain breeds being larger on average.
