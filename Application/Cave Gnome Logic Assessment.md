**1.How did they do this?**

The Gnomes discussed how to organize themselves before they left the cave, not after.

**2.How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process.**

The restrictions state that the Gnomes are not able to communicate with each other visually or verbally once they leave the cave. It did not state they were restricted from verbally  working out a system beforehand. It also did not restrict them from using their own observations, without outward communications from others, to sort themselves once outside.

Upon leaving the cave, the first Gnome would simply need to stand in the center of the clearing facing the mouth of the cave to initiate their line up. Each following Gnome would end up sorting the line from the center by putting all Gnomes with a red forehead on their right and a blue forehead on their left. The last Gnome may never know what color ze has, but it will not be necessary since ze will create the divide in the line for two distict groups.

**3.What other possible explanations are there?**

Upon leaving the cave, the first Gnome would simply need to pick a side, left or right, and claim that as his groupâ€™s area. Each successive Gnome would simply need to walk outside into the light and wipe or scrape some paint from their own forehead to determine if they would join the first Gnome or create the second group. If their colors match they join. The process continues until each Gnome has sorted themselves.
